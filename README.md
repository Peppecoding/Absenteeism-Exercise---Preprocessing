# Absenteeism-Exercise---Preprocessing


## Description
This Jupyter Notebook focuses on preprocessing data related to absenteeism. The preprocessing steps are essential for preparing raw data for analysis or predictive modeling. The notebook demonstrates how to clean, manipulate, and transform datasets to make them suitable for further analytical or machine learning tasks.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, standardizing formats, and eliminating inconsistencies.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features to enhance the dataset's predictive power.
- **Data Transformation**: Normalization, encoding categorical variables, and preparing data for modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistical summaries for initial insights.

## Dependencies
The notebook utilizes the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For data visualization.
- Additional libraries may include `sklearn` for preprocessing tasks.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository containing the notebook and the dataset.
2. Install the required dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

  ## Open the notebook in Jupyter
  
jupyter notebook Absenteeism_Exercise_Preprocessing.ipynb
